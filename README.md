This is an invitation to participate in a study titled “The Labour of Ethical AI”. My name is James Steinhoff and I am a postdoctoral fellow at the Institute of Communication, Culture, Information and Technology at the University of Toronto Mississauga. The aim of this research is to understand the labour that goes into ethical AI research (research intended to promote ethical, responsible, democratic, human-centered, non-profit or socially beneficial AI), the organizations in which such work is conducted, the problems facing workers in this field, and how the field is connected to industry, academia and government. The goal of the study is to interview people who work, study or intern in ethical AI in order to gain empirical insight into the working conditions in this sector. 

If you have experience working in the sector, you could provide great insight into some of the challenges and opportunities facing workers. If you are willing, your participation would involve meeting me for an online interview that will last approximately one hour, where I will ask you questions about your working conditions, why you chose the ethical AI sector and the promises and problems facing that sector. Participation in this project will be confidential. I will supply potential participants with an informed consent form that outlines in greater detail the project and the parameters of participation.
 
I am happy to answer any questions or concerns you might have.
Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

James Steinhoff, PhD
