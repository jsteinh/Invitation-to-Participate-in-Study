# Invitation to Participate in Study "The Labour of Ethical AI"
An invitation for qualified individuals to participate in my study

This is an invitation to participate in a study titled “The Labour of Ethical AI”. My name is James Steinhoff and I am a postdoctoral fellow at the Institute of Communication, Culture, Information and Technology at the University of Toronto Mississauga.

The goal of the study is to interview people who work at non-profit AI institutes and organizations in order to gain empirical insight into the working conditions in this sector. If you have experience working in the non-profit AI sector, you can participate in this study and could provide great insight into some of the challenges and opportunities facing workers.

The aim of this research is to understand how non-profit AI institutes and organizations (organizations which produce output intended to promote ethical, democratic or socially beneficial AI, rather than salable commodities) produce the output they do, what working at such organizations is like, the problems facing workers therein, and how such organizations interact with industry, academia and government.

If you are willing, your participation will involve meeting me for an online interview that will last approximately one hour, where I will ask you questions about your working conditions, why you chose the non-profit AI sector and the promises and problems facing that sector.

Participation in this project will be confidential. I have attached an informed consent form that outlines in greater detail the project and the parameters of your participation.
 
I am happy to answer any questions or concerns you might have.
Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

James Steinhoff, PhD
